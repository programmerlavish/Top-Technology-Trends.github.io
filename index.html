    <p>Technology today is evolving at a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing an acceleration of the rate of change. However, it is not only <b>technology trends</b> and emerging technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year due to the outbreak of <b>COVID-19</b> making IT professionals realize that their role will not stay the same in the contactless world tomorrow. And an IT professional in 2021-22 will constantly be learning, unlearning, and relearning (out of necessity if not desire).</p>
    <p>What does this mean for you? It means staying current with emerging technologies and latest technology trends. And it means keeping your eyes on the future to know which skills you'll need to know to secure a safe job tomorrow and even learn how to get there. All bows to the worldwide pandemic, most of the global IT population is sitting back, working from home. And if you wish to make the most of your time at home, here are the top 9 emerging technology trends you should watch for and make an attempt at in 2022, and possibly secure one of the jobs that will be created by these new technology trends:</p>
    <div>
        <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence(AI)</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early. <b>AI is already known</b> for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.</p>
        <p>Other than that AI will be used further to analyze interactions to determine underlying connections and insights, to help predict demand for services like hospitals enabling authorities to make better decisions about resource utilization, and to detect the changing patterns of customer behaviour by analyzing data in near real-time, driving revenues and enhancing personalized experiences.</p>
        <p>The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching over $57 billion in 2022.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend.</p>
        <p>Machine Learning the subset of AI, is also being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. Forrester predicts AI, machine learning, and automation will create 9 percent of new U.S. jobs by 2025, jobs including robot monitoring professionals,<b>data scientists,</b> automation specialists, and content curators, making it another new technology trend.</p>
        <article><h3>Mastering AI and machine learning will help you secure jobs like:</h3></article>
        <ul>
            <li>AI Research Scientist</li>
            <li>AI Engineer</li>
            <li>Machine Learning Engineer</li>
            <li>AI Architect</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. Robotic Process Automation(RPA)</h2>
        <p>Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA <b>automates</b> repetitive tasks that people used to do.</p>
        <p>Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood of 230 million or more knowledge workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce, RPA is also creating new jobs while altering existing jobs. McKinsey finds that less than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated, but about 60 percent can be partially automated.</p>
        <p>For you as an IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand latest technology trends, RPA offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst, solution architect and consultant. And these jobs pay well. An RPA developer can earn over â‚¹534K per year - making it the next technology trend.</p>
        <article><h3>Mastering RPA will help you secure high paying jobs like:</h3></article>
        <ul>
            <li>RPA Developer</li>
            <li>RPA Analyst</li>
            <li>RPA Architect</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>3. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h2>
        <p>The next exceptional technology trend - Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), and Extended Reality (ER). VR immerses the user in an environment while AR enhances their environment. Although this technology trend has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship.
            <p>In 2022, we can expect these forms of technologies being further integrated into our lives. Usually working in tandem with some of the other emerging technologies we've mentioned in this list, AR and VR have enormous potential in training, entertainment, education, marketing, and even rehabilitation after an injury. Either could be used to train doctors to do surgery, offer museum goers a deeper experience, enhance theme parks, or even enhance marketing, as with this Pepsi Max bus shelter.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: 14 million AR and VR devices were sold in 2019. The global AR and VR market is expected to grow to $209.2 billion by 2022, only creating more opportunities in the trending technology, and welcoming more professionals ready for this game-changing field.</p>
            <p>While some employers might look for optics as a skill-set, note that getting started in VR doesn't require a lot of specialized knowledge - basic programming skills and a forward-thinking mindset can land a job; another reason why this new technology trend should make up to your list of lookouts!</p>
