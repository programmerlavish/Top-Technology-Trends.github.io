        <p>The AI market will grow to a <b>$190 billion industry</b> by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching over $57 billion in 2022.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend.</p>
        <p>Machine Learning the subset of AI, is also being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals.
